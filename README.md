## 🎯 Problem Statement & Vision

### The Problem
India's gig workers (delivery agents, ride-share drivers, micro-entrepreneurs) face a unique vulnerability: **when external events disrupt their ability to work, their income drops to zero**. Unlike salaried employees, they have:
- No paid leave or sick days
- No employer-provided insurance against weather events
- No safety net during monsoons, heatwaves, or pollution emergencies
- No bargaining power to negotiate downtime compensation

A Zomato rider in Mumbai loses ₹800-1500 per day during heavy monsoon flooding. A Swiggy driver in Delhi can't work when AQI exceeds 400. A Blinkit rider in Chennai faces cyclone shutdowns. **These are predictable, measurable events — but no affordable insurance product exists for them.**

### Our Vision
GigShield reimagines insurance as a **real-time, data-driven safety net** that:
- Uses weather APIs + AI to **automatically detect** when a worker can't work
- **Triggers instant payouts** without claims paperwork
- Keeps premiums **micro and weekly** (₹29-129/week) to match gig income cycles
- Uses **AI-powered fraud detection** to maintain pool integrity
- Provides **proactive alerts** so workers can plan ahead

---

## 👤 Persona-Based Scenarios

### Persona 1: Raju Kumar — Zomato Delivery Partner, Mumbai
- **Age:** 24 | **Weekly Earnings:** ₹4,000-5,000 | **Zone:** Mumbai - Dadar
- **Platform:** Zomato | **Policy:** Standard (₹49/week)

**Scenario:** On a Monday during peak monsoon, Mumbai receives 120mm rainfall in 3 hours. Raju's zone (Dadar) is waterlogged. He cannot safely deliver.

**GigShield Flow:**
1. Weather API detects rainfall > 100mm/hr in zone `mum-dad`
2. System auto-creates an `RAIN_EXTREME` incident (severity: 85)
3. Raju's active policy is matched → claim auto-generated for ₹600 (4 hours × ₹150/hr × 1.0x Standard multiplier)
4. AI fraud check runs: GPS confirms Raju is in-zone, weather data verified, anomaly score 0.02 → **approved**
5. Payout of ₹600 initiated to Raju's UPI within minutes
6. Raju gets a push notification: "₹600 credited — stay safe! 🛡️"

### Persona 2: Priya Sharma — Swiggy Delivery Executive, Delhi
- **Age:** 28 | **Weekly Earnings:** ₹3,500 | **Zone:** Delhi - Connaught Place
- **Platform:** Swiggy | **Policy:** Basic (₹29/week)

**Scenario:** Delhi experiences AQI > 450 for 6 consecutive hours in winter. Priya has respiratory issues and cannot work.

**GigShield Flow:**
1. AQI API detects AQI > 400 sustained for 4+ hours in zone `del-cp`
2. `AQI_SEVERE` incident created (severity: 70)
3. Priya's Basic policy triggers → claim for ₹480 (4 hours × ₹150/hr × 0.8x Basic multiplier)
4. Fraud check: AQI confirmed by government sensors, Priya's location verified → **approved**
5. Payout processed automatically

### Persona 3: Arjun Reddy — Amazon Flex Driver, Hyderabad
- **Age:** 32 | **Weekly Earnings:** ₹6,000 | **Zone:** Hyderabad - HITEC City
- **Platform:** Amazon Flex | **Policy:** Pro (₹99/week)

**Scenario:** Arjun tries to file a claim for "heavy rain" but the weather data shows only 15mm rainfall — well below threshold.

**GigShield Flow:**
1. Arjun submits a manual report via the Worker Report panel
2. System checks weather data: rainfall only 15mm (threshold: 50mm) → **no matching incident**
3. AI fraud scoring: anomaly score 0.78, GPS shows Arjun was 12km from claimed zone
4. Claim auto-flagged with fraud score 0.78 → **flagged for review**
5. Admin reviews and rejects; Arjun's Shield Score drops from 72 to 58
6. Higher fraud score means higher future premiums (deterrent effect)

## 💰 Weekly Premium Model

### Why Weekly?
Gig workers earn daily/weekly — monthly premiums don't align with their cash flow. Our weekly model ensures:
- **Affordability:** ₹29-129/week vs ₹500+ monthly traditional plans
- **Flexibility:** Workers can pause/resume coverage
- **Cash flow alignment:** Premiums match earning cycles

### Tier Structure

| Tier | Weekly Premium | Max Payout/Week | Payout Multiplier | Target Worker |
|------|---------------|-----------------|-------------------|---------------|
| **BASIC** | ₹29-49 | ₹2,000 | 0.8x | Low-earning / new workers |
| **STANDARD** | ₹49-79 | ₹3,000 | 1.0x | Average earners |
| **PRO** | ₹79-129 | ₹4,000 | 1.2x | High earners / high-risk zones |

### Dynamic Premium Formula

```
Premium = Base Price × Zone Risk Factor × Season Factor × Claim History Discount
```

| Factor | Range | Description |
|--------|-------|-------------|
| **Base Price** | ₹29-99 (by tier) | Fixed base per tier |
| **Zone Risk Factor** | 0.5 - 2.0 | Based on zone's historical incident rate |
| **Season Factor** | 1.0 - 1.3 | Higher during monsoon (Jun-Sep), winter smog (Nov-Jan) |
| **Claim History Discount** | 0.95 | 5% discount if 0 claims in last 4 weeks |

**Example:** Pro tier in Mumbai-Dadar (risk: 0.78) during monsoon (season: 1.2):
```
₹99 × 1.56 (zone) × 1.2 (season) × 1.0 (no discount) = ₹185/week
```

### Payout Calculation

```
Payout = Lost Hours × ₹150/hr × Tier Multiplier
```

- Capped at weekly `max_payout` per tier
- Lost hours estimated from incident duration (minimum 2 hours per incident)

## ⚡ Parametric Triggers

Parametric insurance pays out based on **measurable, objective data** — not subjective damage assessment. Our triggers:

| Trigger ID | Event | Data Source | Threshold | Typical Severity |
|-----------|-------|-------------|-----------|-----------------|
| `RAIN_HEAVY` | Heavy Rainfall | OpenWeatherMap | > 50mm/hr for 2+ hrs | 50-70 |
| `RAIN_EXTREME` | Extreme Rain / Flood | OpenWeatherMap + Gov alerts | > 100mm/hr OR flood alert | 70-95 |
| `HEAT_EXTREME` | Extreme Heat | OpenWeatherMap | > 45°C for 3+ hrs | 60-85 |
| `AQI_SEVERE` | Severe Air Quality | OpenWeatherMap AQI API | AQI > 400 for 4+ hrs | 60-80 |
| `CURFEW_LOCAL` | Local Curfew/Bandh | Manual admin input | Verified curfew in zone | 70-90 |
| `STORM_CYCLONE` | Cyclone / Storm | OpenWeatherMap + IMD | Severe weather alert issued | 80-100 |

### How Triggers Work:
1. **Weather Polling:** Edge function `weather-poll` runs every 15 minutes, fetching data for all zones
2. **Threshold Check:** If any metric exceeds trigger threshold, an `incident` is created
3. **Auto-Claim:** The `fire-trigger` edge function matches affected workers' policies and auto-generates claims
4. **Severity Scoring:** Based on how far the reading exceeds the threshold (e.g., 200mm rain = higher severity than 60mm)

---

## 📱 Platform Choice: Web (PWA)

### Why Web over Native Mobile?

| Factor | Web (PWA) ✅ | Native App ❌ |
|--------|-------------|--------------|
| **Installation barrier** | No app store download needed | Requires Play Store download |
| **Storage concern** | Zero device storage | 50-100MB on low-end phones |
| **Update cycle** | Instant updates | App store review delays |
| **Development speed** | Single codebase | Separate Android/iOS |
| **Target devices** | Works on any browser | Needs specific OS versions |
| **Data usage** | Lightweight | Heavy initial download |
| **Offline support** | Service Worker caching | Full offline |

### Why PWA specifically?
- **India's gig workers use budget Android phones** with limited storage — PWA has near-zero footprint
- **Installable:** "Add to Home Screen" gives app-like experience without app store
- **Push Notifications:** Service Workers enable real-time weather alerts
- **Works on 2G/3G:** Optimized for Indian network conditions
- **Mobile-first UI:** Designed for one-handed, on-the-go usage during delivery breaks

---

## 🤖 AI/ML Integration

### 1. Dynamic Premium Calculation (`calculate-premium` edge function)
- **Input:** Worker zone, tier, claim history, current season, zone risk score
- **AI Role:** Zone risk scores are computed from historical weather data + incident frequency using weighted models
- **Output:** Personalized weekly premium that reflects real-time risk

### 2. AI-Powered Fraud Detection (`worker-report` + `fire-trigger` edge functions)
Every claim goes through a multi-layered fraud scoring pipeline:

```
Fraud Score = weighted_sum(
  GPS Proximity Check     (30%) — Is the worker actually in the claimed zone?
  Weather Verification    (25%) — Does weather data confirm the claimed event?
  Claim Velocity Check    (20%) — How many claims in the last 6 hours?
  Amount Anomaly Detection(15%) — Is the amount unusually high for this trigger?
  Behavioral Patterns     (10%) — Historical claim patterns, time-of-day analysis
)
```

| Score Range | Action | Description |
|-------------|--------|-------------|
| 0.0 - 0.3 | **Auto-Approve** | Low risk, verified by data |
| 0.3 - 0.7 | **Processing** | Needs automated review |
| 0.7 - 1.0 | **Flagged** | Sent to admin for manual review |

### 3. Predictive AI Alerts (`ai-predict` edge function)
- Uses **Gemini AI** (via Lovable AI gateway) to analyze weather patterns
- Predicts probability of disruption events **24-48 hours in advance**
- Generates city-level forecasts: event type, probability %, estimated claims volume, reserve requirements
- Workers see proactive alerts: *"⚠️ Heavy Monsoon Rainfall expected in your area (88% chance)"*

### 4. Shield Score — Worker Trust Metric
An AI-computed trust score (0-100) for each worker:
- **Increases:** Verified claims, long tenure, consistent zone presence
- **Decreases:** Flagged claims, GPS mismatches, unusual patterns
- **Impact:** Higher scores → lower premiums, priority payouts

### 5. Fraud Network Visualization (Admin Dashboard)
- AI identifies clusters of suspicious activity (e.g., multiple workers claiming same fabricated event)
- Graph visualization shows connections between workers, incidents, and anomalies
- Helps admins spot organized fraud rings

## 🚀 Implemented Features (Deep Dive)

### 1. 🔔 Real-Time Notifications System
Workers receive instant in-app alerts without needing to check the dashboard manually.

**How it works:**
- **Database triggers** (`notify_on_incident`, `notify_on_claim_update`, `notify_on_payout_update`) automatically insert into the `notifications` table whenever an incident fires, a claim status changes, or a payout completes
- **Supabase Realtime** subscription pushes new notifications to the client instantly via `postgres_changes` on the `notifications` table filtered by `user_id`
- **Notification Bell** (`NotificationBell.tsx`) in the header shows unread count badge and a dropdown with full notification history
- **WhatsApp-styled toasts** (via Sonner) pop up with color-coded gradients: amber for weather ⚠️, green for payouts 💰, blue for claims 📋
- **Mark as read / Mark all read** — workers can dismiss individual or all notifications
- **Notification types:** `weather`, `claim`, `payout` — stored as a PostgreSQL enum
- **RLS policies** ensure workers only see their own notifications; admins can manage all

**Tech:** Supabase Realtime, PostgreSQL triggers (SECURITY DEFINER), Sonner toast library, Framer Motion animations

### 2. 🧭 Worker Onboarding Flow
A guided 5-step wizard that gets new workers protected in under 90 seconds.

**Steps:**
1. **Account** — Name, email, password with real-time validation; creates auth user + auto-generates worker profile via `handle_new_user()` trigger
2. **Platform** — Select delivery platform (Zomato, Swiggy, Zepto, Blinkit, Amazon Flex, Flipkart, Dunzo) with branded icons
3. **Zone** — Choose primary delivery zone from database; shows **Zone Risk Preview** with risk score, recent incidents, and weather data
4. **Shield Score** — Animated gauge explainer showing the 4 factors (Weather Risk, Claim History, Seasonality, Loyalty) that determine their trust score and premiums
5. **Plan** — Choose BASIC/STANDARD/PRO tier with dynamic premium preview calculated via the `calculate-premium` edge function based on selected zone risk

**Key details:**
- Progress bar with step indicators
- Back navigation between steps
- Zone data fetched from `zones` table with city grouping
- Policy created on completion with correct tier, premium, and date range
- Smooth Framer Motion transitions between steps

**Tech:** Multi-step form state, Supabase Auth, `calculate-premium` edge function, animated ShieldScoreGauge component

### 3. ⚖️ Claims Appeal / Dispute Workflow
Workers can dispute flagged or rejected claims with photo evidence and written explanations.

**Worker side:**
- **Appeal Dialog** (`AppealDialog.tsx`) opens from the Claim History page for any flagged/rejected claim
- Workers write a detailed reason for the dispute
- **Photo evidence upload** — multiple images uploaded to Supabase Storage `evidence` bucket with worker-scoped paths
- Appeal stored in `appeals` table with `status: pending`, linked to the claim via `claim_id`
- Workers can track appeal status (pending → approved/rejected) in their claim history

**Admin side:**
- **Appeals queue** in the Admin Dashboard with `review-appeal` edge function
- Admins see the original claim details, fraud score, worker's appeal reason, and uploaded evidence
- Admins can approve (which updates claim status to approved and triggers payout) or reject with admin notes
- All actions logged with timestamps

**Security:** RLS ensures workers can only create/view their own appeals; admins can manage all appeals

**Tech:** Supabase Storage (public `evidence` bucket), `submit-appeal` + `review-appeal` edge functions, Dialog component

### 4. 🔮 Predictive Risk Dashboard
AI-powered forecasting of upcoming weather disruptions so workers can prepare and admins can pre-allocate funds.

**How it works:**
- **`ai-predict` edge function** calls Google Gemini 2.5 Flash via the Lovable AI Gateway
- Analyzes current weather readings, historical incident data, and seasonal patterns per zone
- Returns structured predictions: event type, probability (%), estimated affected workers, projected claims volume, and recommended reserve allocation

**Worker view (Alerts page → Predictions tab):**
- Cards showing predicted events for their zone in the next 24-48 hours
- Color-coded probability indicators (green < 40%, amber 40-70%, red > 70%)
- Actionable advice: "Consider staying home tomorrow" or "Your coverage is active"

**Admin view (Predictions tab):**
- City-level forecast table with all zones
- Aggregate projected claims and reserve requirements
- Helps admins pre-allocate funds before events hit

**Tech:** Lovable AI Gateway (Gemini 2.5 Flash), structured tool calling for JSON output, Recharts for visualization

### 5. 📊 Worker Earnings Impact Report
Shows workers exactly how much income they lost vs. how much GigShield covered — reinforcing the platform's value.

**Earnings Report page (`EarningsReportPage.tsx`):**
- **Income Loss vs. Coverage chart** — visual comparison of estimated lost earnings during incidents vs. actual GigShield payouts
- **Coverage ratio** — percentage of lost income recovered (e.g., "GigShield covered 78% of your weather-related income loss")
- **Breakdown by event type** — separate analysis for rain, heat, AQI events
- **Weekly/monthly trend** — line chart showing protection value over time
- **ROI calculation** — total premiums paid vs. total payouts received

**Data sources:** Joins `claims`, `payouts`, `policies`, and `incidents` tables to compute comprehensive earnings impact

**Tech:** Recharts (AreaChart, BarChart), Supabase queries with joins, responsive card layout

---

### 6. 📈 Admin Cohort Analytics
Deep analytics for admin decision-making — retention, churn, and renewal rates segmented by city, platform, and tier.

**Cohort Analytics Tab (`CohortAnalyticsTab.tsx`):**
- **Retention heatmap** — month-over-month worker retention rates
- **Churn prediction** — identifies workers at risk of not renewing based on claim frequency, Shield Score trends, and engagement
- **Policy renewal rates** — segmented by:
  - **City:** Mumbai vs. Delhi vs. Bangalore vs. Hyderabad vs. Chennai
  - **Platform:** Zomato vs. Swiggy vs. Zepto vs. Blinkit vs. Amazon Flex
  - **Tier:** BASIC vs. STANDARD vs. PRO
- **Key metrics:** Active workers, total premiums collected, loss ratio, average Shield Score
- **Trend charts:** Worker growth over time, premium revenue trends

**Tech:** Recharts (PieChart, LineChart, BarChart), Supabase aggregation queries, Tabs component for segmentation

---

### 7. 🔍 Payout Proof / Transparency Ledger
A worker-visible audit trail of all trigger events → claims → payouts for trust-building.

**Transparency Ledger (`TransparencyLedger.tsx`):**
- **End-to-end trail** for every payout: Weather Event → Incident Created → Claim Generated → Fraud Check → Approval → Payout Completed
- **Timeline view** — each step shown with timestamp, status, and relevant data (weather reading, fraud score, payout amount)
- **Filterable** by date range, event type, and status
- **Public verification** — workers can see that the system is fair and automated
- **Incident details** — links to the original weather data that triggered the event
- **Claim transparency** — shows fraud score and why the claim was approved/flagged

**Admin view:** Full ledger across all workers with aggregate statistics
**Worker view:** Personal ledger filtered to their own claims and payouts

**Tech:** Supabase joins across `incidents` → `claims` → `payouts` tables, Table component, Badge status indicators, date-fns formatting
